        <p>If you have opened this website, It is because your car is boring and you want to make it more powerful. So, you have come to the right place.  On this website, I will be talking about 15 ways to make your car better and more exciting. but first, look at your country's rules and if you can modify your car.</p>
        <p>also, it can be expensive and time-consuming so I made it from most important to least important,  and if you are Surius then continue and take it as a fun project so that you don't get bored and quit the product. imagine telling your future children your car and letting them drive it. have fun!!</p>

        <h1>Turbocharger or Supercharger</h1>
        <p>turbocharger and supercharger are different and work differently with each having there are advantages and disadvantages. let's start with the turbocharger,  a turbo work by using the car exhaust a fan is turned that is connected to the other side which is the intake side the tow side are connected and when the exhaust side turns the other side sucks air and take it to the intake of the car. </p>
        <p> On the other hand, supercharger connects to the drive belt of the car which means that it has less lag.  then the movement will go to a fan that squashes air then goes to the intake. also, to increase the efficiency of them both then get a small radiator that Is between the intake and supercharger to cool the hot air.</p>

        <h1>race tires</h1>
        <p>there are many types of tires compound each with there on properties. just like plastic some are strong and some weak. for maximum grip  pick race tires. in a track, it can make your car faster by 5 seconds if you have a race tire. but keep in mind these types of tires are very expensive.</p>

        <h1>tunnable ECU</h1>
        <p>An ECU is  what controls the car and disables and enables stuff. It has many functions like TCS, ABS and more but the stock ECU is not tunable -  by that I mean change the ignition time, amount of fuel and much . If you don't do it,  you are hiding potential power and this makes the  car  engine unreliable.  Further,  without it,  cars can wheel-spin, brakes can lock up and a magnitude of other events,  so changing them would make it a lot better. Even though you will need to reconnect the hundreds of wires in the car.</p>
        

        <h1>better fuel injectors</h1>
        <p>Inside the engine, there are lots of combustion reactions taking place. To obtain more power and speed, you should try to make these combustion reactions more powerful. The kit you buy should contain better fuel pumps and injectors that your previous ones. If you try to apply this change, It is recommended that you change the entire fuel system.</p>

        <h1>wider wheels</h1>
        <p>Have you ever seen drag cars? Its tires are huge and wide. Wider tires mean more contact with the ground.  If you have a rear-wheel-drive car then it would be extremely beneficial to have wider tires, and its effect can be felt. However, if the tire is too big then the extra mass can make your car slower and produce more drag. Therefore, you shouldn't don't get carried away with the size of the tires. Try to optimize and balance it according to your car's power.</p>
       

        <h1>rear wing</h1>
        <p>Wings work on Newton's third law of motion, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. This is applied by the wings by moving any air that hits it up. This air is moved up by the wing, therefore pushing the car down. This is especially found in rear-wheel cars were adding weight to the back of the car will greatly help it become faster. However, wings also produce some drag which could slow the car down. Therefore, it is recommended to find the perfect balance. </p>

        <h1>rear Differentials</h1>
        <p>a rear differential will split the power 50/50 to each wheel. there are two ways a free one and time consuming one. the free one is to weld your differential together but this creates stress in turning and can cause it to break. On the other hand, buying a differential will split the power but you have to remove the whole assembly and change a single piece.</p>
          
        
        <h1>better front bumper</h1>
        <p>since the front bumper is what gets hit by the air then buying a more aerodynamic front bumper will increase the car's top speed and downforce acting on a car and making it more effective in range and better at handling and speed. if you want to be a pro then get a carbon fiber one even though it will cost a lot.c</p>

        <h1>cold air intake</h1>
        <p>The more you use your engine the hotter it gets, which heats the air around, therefore reducing the car's performance. That's why cold air intake is almost always beneficial. However, what is cold air intake? A cold air intake moves the intake away from the engine (that has hotter air) to a cooler area (usually around the fenders). This cold air helps in increasing horsepower. It mostly provides the car with 10-15 more horsepower, depending on the user's car.</p>

        <h1>Remove Extra Weight</h1>
         <p>If you are looking to go faster and not use your car as a daily transportation method, then remove everything like the interior, back seats, plastic, and everything that is not important. If you ever saw a NASCAR automobile it has nothing inside just like all other sports or racing cars. That is basically how your car will look like if you remove all the extra weight. </p>

         <h1>better flowing exhaust</h1>
         <p>if you own an old car then get this improvement will add more power than a modern car. but firstly, what is the difference, a wider exhaust that has no catalytic converter or muffler would allow for the exhaust to leave faster so that it can reave higher. it would benefit more in you added a turbo or supercharger I the car.</p>
         

         <h1>engine swap</h1>
          <p>If your car reached its performance limit, it's mostly because of the engine. If you want to increase your car's total horsepower and increase its performance overall, it is recommended that you swap the car's engine with a newer or better model (provided you have the resources). However, you should first check your car's engine bay as the new engine might not fit inside the car.  The one disadvantage of engine swapping is that it costs a lot of money, and needs lots of work. (I would honestly recommend the 2jz engine)</p>

          <h1> better pistons</h1>
          <p>buy better pistons Better pistons extend more the normal ones, therefore increasing the car's compression ratio. The compression ratio is how much a piston extends from its original position. Most of the time, 10 to 1 is a high compression ratio. However, keep in mind that the cylinder walls might not be able to hold the pressure, which could ruin your modified engine (unless it is a 2jz engine).</p>


          <h1> nos kit</h1>
           <p>NOS stands for dinitro oxide or in simpler terms, two nitrogen (di stands for two in Latin) and one oxygen atoms. Nevertheless, for a combustion reaction to take place you need fuel, oxygen, and an initiator (heat, spark or more). The more oxygen presents the stronger the reaction. However, if there is too much air and not enough fuel then the mixture will become lean, therefore, reducing the power produced. That's why NOS kits are needed. They are short-lived but offer the engine the perfect balance in the fuel: air ratio</p>

           <h1>swap your gearbox </h1>
           <p>swap your car transmission to a duel clutch transmission because it can change gears in a few milliseconds, unlike the traditional transmission that takes a lot longer.  also, change your flywheel to remove 20 to 40 pounds off your car while you are there.  it would help to survive the 2000 hp engine and not break.</p>
